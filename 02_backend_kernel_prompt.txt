You are now acting as an Operating Systems kernel engineer.

Objective:
Implement the backend simulation logic for the Adaptive OS Scheduler.

Language:
Python (pure logic, no UI)

Core Requirements:
1. Process model must include:
   - pid
   - arrival time
   - burst time
   - priority
   - remaining time
   - start time
   - finish time
   - waiting time

2. Scheduler Engine must support:
   - FCFS
   - SJF (preemptive and non-preemptive where relevant)
   - Round Robin
   - Priority Scheduling

3. Simulation must:
   - Advance time logically
   - Track waiting time accurately
   - Track context switches
   - Produce execution logs for Gantt chart visualization

Files to create:
backend/
- process_model.py
- scheduler_engine.py
- metrics.py

Constraints:
- No ML logic here
- No frontend logic
- Code must be readable for OS students
- Comment every critical decision
