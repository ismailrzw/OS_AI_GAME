You are now acting as a Machine Learning engineer.

Objective:
Train an AI model that learns which scheduling algorithm is optimal
based on system mode and process queue characteristics.

Model:
- Decision Tree Classifier (scikit-learn)

Training Strategy:
- Generate ~30,000 synthetic scenarios
- Each scenario:
  - 4 to 8 processes
  - Random arrivals, bursts, priorities
  - Random mode (Efficiency, Fairness, Real-Time)

Scoring Rules (CRITICAL):
1. Efficiency Mode:
   - Score = Avg Waiting Time + (Context Switches × 0.5)

2. Fairness Mode:
   - Score = Max Waiting Time
   - If Max Wait > 15 → +100 penalty

3. Real-Time Mode:
   - Score = Avg Waiting Time
   - If Low priority finishes before High → +200 penalty per violation

Label:
- Algorithm with LOWEST score wins

Files to create:
data_factory/
- generator.py
- scorer.py
- train.py
- dataset.csv

Output:
- Trained model saved as models/scheduler_brain.pkl

Constraints:
- This training logic MUST force algorithm diversity
- Explain feature selection clearly
