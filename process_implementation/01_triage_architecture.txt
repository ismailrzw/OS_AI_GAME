You are a senior system designer.

Objective:
Design a Triage Doctor Scheduling Simulator where Humans compete against AI under realistic hospital constraints.

Core Concept:
- Simulate a hospital triage system with patients, doctors, queues, and metrics.
- Patients deteriorate over time.
- Resources are limited; interruptions have costs.
- Human and AI compete to schedule optimally.
- AI uses a Decision Tree to pick the best scheduling algorithm per state snapshot.

State:
S(t) = {patients, doctors, queue, context, metrics}
- Evolves every tick
- Depends on previous actions
- Never static

AI Input Features:
- level_1_count
- level_2_count
- avg_wait_time
- max_wait_time
- doctor_utilization
- deterioration_velocity
- interrupt_cost
- surge_active

AI Output:
- Best scheduling policy at the moment

Frontend Pages:
- Mode Selection
- Triage Board
- Policy Selector
- Timeline View
- Result Analysis

Constraints:
- Do NOT generate code yet
- Focus on clean system architecture
- Separate backend, AI training, and frontend
- Ensure React + Vite will be used for frontend
