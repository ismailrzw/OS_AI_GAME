You are now acting as a systems integrator.

Objective:
Connect backend, AI, and React frontend into a full system.

Flow:
1. App starts (React frontend)
2. User selects mode
3. Frontend requests patient queue from backend
4. Human schedules patients via UI
5. Backend simulates human schedule and computes metrics
6. AI predicts best algorithm for current state
7. Backend simulates AI schedule
8. Frontend visualizes results side-by-side (Gantt Chart, metrics)
9. Scores and feedback shown to user

Deliverables:
- API contract for backend/frontend
- Clear step-by-step runtime explanation
- Integration notes on React components and Python backend
- Use AI model for runtime inference

Constraints:
- No new feature creation
- Connect everything cleanly and maintain modularity
