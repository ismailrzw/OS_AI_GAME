You are now acting as a backend engineer.

Objective:
Implement the hospital triage simulation engine in Python.

Requirements:
1. Patient model must include:
   - id, triage_level (1–5), arrival_time, estimated_service_time
   - wait_time, deterioration_rate, risk_score, resources_needed

2. Scheduler Engine must support:
   - FCFS, SJF, SRTF, Round Robin, Priority, Hybrid

3. Simulation Tick Logic:
   - New patients arrive
   - Existing patients deteriorate
   - Triage levels may change
   - Scheduler runs
   - Doctors treat/preempt
   - Metrics update

4. Files to create:
backend/
- process_model.py
- scheduler_engine.py
- metrics.py
- ai_interface.py

Constraints:
- No frontend logic here
- Backend must provide clean API endpoints for React frontend later
- Comment critical decisions
