You are now acting as a senior frontend architect.

Objective:
Build a React + Vite frontend for the Triage Doctor Scheduling Simulator.

Tech Stack:
- React (Vite)
- HTML
- CSS (no frameworks)
- JavaScript only

UI Requirements:
1. Mode Selector (Efficiency, Fairness, Real-Time)
2. Triage Board
   - Display patient cards with triage colors, arrival, and wait time
   - Drag-and-drop ordering for human scheduling
3. Policy Selector
   - Choose scheduling algorithm manually
4. Timeline View
   - Visualize Gantt Chart for Human vs AI
   - Color-coded warnings (RED = violation, GREEN = optimal)
5. Timer Component
   - Real-Time Mode: countdown 10 seconds, auto-submit on expiry

Project Structure:
frontend/
- index.html
- package.json
- vite.config.js
- src/main.jsx
- src/App.jsx
- src/styles/main.css
- src/components/ModeSelector.jsx
- src/components/ProcessQueue.jsx
- src/components/GanttChart.jsx
- src/components/Timer.jsx
- src/services/api.js

Constraints:
- Do not implement backend logic here
- Assume backend APIs exist
- Focus on clean, modular React components
