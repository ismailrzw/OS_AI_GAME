You are now acting as a machine learning engineer.

Objective:
Train a Decision Tree AI that selects the best scheduling algorithm for the hospital triage system.

Training Data:
- Generate thousands of synthetic hospital scenarios
- Randomized arrival rates, deterioration speeds, staffing, surges
- Evaluate all algorithms (FCFS, SJF, SRTF, RR, Priority, Hybrid)
- Label the algorithm with the lowest total cost

Cost Function:
total_cost = death_penalty + max_wait_penalty + interrupt_penalty + fairness_penalty

Files to create:
data_factory/
- generator.py
- scorer.py
- train.py
- dataset.csv

Output:
- Trained model saved as models/scheduler_brain.pkl

Constraints:
- Training logic must force algorithm diversity
- Explain feature selection clearly
- Keep backend API in mind for runtime inference
