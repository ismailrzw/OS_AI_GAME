You are now acting as a systems integrator.

Objective:
Describe and finalize the end-to-end flow of the system.

Flow to explain:
1. App starts
2. Mode is selected
3. Process queue generated
4. Human schedules processes
5. Backend simulates Human result
6. AI predicts best algorithm
7. Backend simulates AI result
8. Results visualized side-by-side

Deliverables:
- Clear execution sequence
- API contract explanation
- How frontend talks to backend
- How AI model is used during runtime

Constraints:
- No new features
- Just connect everything cleanly
- Presentation-ready explanation
