You are a senior Operating Systems architect and system designer.

Objective:
Design an Adaptive OS Scheduler Simulation where a Human competes against an AI scheduler.

Core Concept:
The system operates in THREE MODES (not difficulty levels):

1. Efficiency Mode (Batch Processing)
   - Goal: Minimize Average Waiting Time
   - Penalize context switching heavily

2. Fairness Mode (Time Sharing)
   - Goal: Prevent starvation
   - Penalize maximum waiting time

3. Real-Time Mode (Mission Critical)
   - Goal: Immediate execution of high-priority tasks
   - Penalize priority violations massively
   - Human must schedule within a strict countdown timer

AI Role:
- Acts as a "Next-Gen Scheduler"
- Chooses between FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority
- Uses a Decision Tree classifier
- Input: Statistical features of process queue + mode
- Output: Best scheduling algorithm

Human Role:
- Manually schedules processes via UI
- Subject to time pressure in Real-Time Mode

Deliverables:
1. High-level system architecture
2. Clear separation of Backend, AI Training, and Frontend
3. Explanation suitable for OS course presentation

Constraints:
- Do NOT generate code yet
- Lock design decisions clearly
- Avoid shortcuts or simplifications
