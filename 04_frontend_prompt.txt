Objective:
Build a React + Vite frontend for the Adaptive OS Scheduler simulation.

UI Requirements:
1. Mode Selector
   - Efficiency
   - Fairness
   - Real-Time

2. Process Queue View
   - Display PID, Burst, Arrival, Priority
   - Allow drag-and-drop ordering (Human scheduling)

3. Real-Time Mode
   - Visible countdown timer (10 seconds)
   - Auto-submit when timer expires

4. Visualization
   - Gantt Chart (Human vs AI)
   - Color-coded warnings (RED = violation, GREEN = optimal)

Project Structure:
